## Todo Application

# Overview

This repository contains a Todo application built using React and TypeScript, bundled with Vite for a fast development experience. The project demonstrates the use of modern React hooks, such as useContext, useMemo, and useState, to create an efficient and responsive task management app.

## Key Features

- React Hooks: Implements useState for state management, useContext for global state sharing, and useMemo for performance optimization.
- TypeScript: Adds type safety and better code readability.
- Vite: Ensures a lightning-fast development server and optimized build process.
- CRUD Operations: Allows users to create, update, mark complete, and delete tasks.
- Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- React: For building the user interface.
- TypeScript: For static type checking.
- Vite: For modern, fast development and build tooling.
- CSS: For custom styling.

## What's Inside

- Task List: Displays all tasks with options to mark as complete or delete.
- Task Input Form: Allows users to add new tasks.
- State Management: Global state management with useContext.
- Performance Enhancements: Uses useMemo to optimize rendering.
- Setup and Installation

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Run the development sever:
   npm run dev

4. Build for production:

```
npm run build
```

5. Preview the build:

```
npm run preview
```

## How It Works

- useState: Manages task states (e.g., task list, input field).
- useContext: Provides a shared state across components for efficient data flow.
- useMemo: Optimizes rendering by memoizing calculated values.

## Customization Tips

- Modify the styles in src/styles for a unique look.
- Add more features, such as task prioritization or due dates, for extra functionality.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement drag-and-drop task reordering.
